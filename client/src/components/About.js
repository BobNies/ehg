                    <p>My earliest sculptures were 3D realizations of my fairly
                      detailed drawings.  This approach led to developing a personal
                      language and evolved into a more direct process where I
                      entered into a dialogue with the stone with no preconceived
                      direction, only to speak this language through this rock.
                      This method is most akin to play- free-spirited exploring
                      form, wherever it leads; like a child digging tunnels or
                      building castles in the sand.  Beauty matters - classical
                      elements are significant components of this language - line,
                      curve, edge, proportion, negative space, textureâ€¦  How they
                      some to be in a new unique combination, that is my fun, my
                      joy.  On a good day, that joy is shared.</p>
